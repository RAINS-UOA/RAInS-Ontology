<span class="markdown">
The RAInS ontology is an ex-tension of of the System Accountability Ontology (SAO) for the AI systemsâ€™ domain by defining a set of concepts required to document the design stage of such systems. Subclasses of sao:AccountableAction and sao:AccountableResult are defined to provide a minimal set of high-level constructs for describing accountability plans consisting of actions producing design specifications(e.g. a ML model de-sign specification) and human decisions(e.g. approval of a specification by an accountable person). The ontology will be extended in the future to cover additional system life cycle stages. See also https://w3id.org/sao
