<span class="markdown">The RAInS ontology is an extension of the <a href="https://w3id.org/sao">System Accountability Ontology (SAO)</a> for the AI systemsâ€™ domain by defining a set of concepts required to document the life cycle stages of such systems. Subclasses of sao:AccountableAction and sao:AccountableResult are defined to provide a minimal set of high-level constructs for describing accountability plans consisting of actions producing design specifications(e.g. a ML model design specification) and human decisions(e.g. approval of a specification by an accountable person). This ontology also defines a number of sao:InformationElement(s) that can be used as members of sao:InformationRealization to describe the actual sao:AccountableResult(s) in the accountability trace. This is version 3 of the ontology and covers Design Stage, Implementation Stage, Desployment Stage (Installation, Manuals Production, and User Training) Operation Stage (Configuration, Maintenance, and Runtime).</span>

The work on this ontology was completed on 31 July 2022 but the ontology was updated online on 05 Aug 2024.
